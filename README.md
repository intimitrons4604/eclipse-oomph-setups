# Eclipse Oomph Setups

**This repository is archived.** FRC has replaced Eclipse with Visual Studio Code.

This repository contains an index and product catalogs for use by Eclipse Oomph (the Eclipse installer).

Currently the catalog only conatains a single product based on the Eclipse Oxygen IDE for C/C++ Developers. The product also adds the FRC plugins to Eclipse and sets a few preferences. The product defined here is used by the development tool install script to install Eclipse.

To use this index in Eclipse Oomph, add it through the user interface or [host](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Authoring#Hosting_your_own_index_.2F_catalogs) it somewhere as outlined in the Eclipse Oomph Authoring documentation.

**For team laptops, the development tool install script redirects the Eclipse Oomph index to this repository. As a result, any changes to the product in this repository will be automatically applied to Eclipse on the team laptops when Eclipse starts.**
